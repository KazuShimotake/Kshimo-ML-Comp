# Kshimo-ML-Comp
Assignment submission from a machine learning competition with a professor.

Class averages were compared with the professor's averages(average 86.382):
86.33999999999999
86.6
86.52
86.39
86.06

We got a higher average so we got extra credit.

I based mine off a classmate'smodel setup that initially got an accuracy of around 91% when I split the data into training and validation sets, but I had a lot of fun playing around with the neural net and seeing how it went, so I submitted a version with 10 layers because it resulted in one 99% on one of my validation tests. It's pretty slow to train but most of my fiddling has resulted in generally accurate results.
